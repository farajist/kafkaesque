# Kafkaesque
_Kafkaesque_ is a test library whose aim is to make the experience in testing Kafka application less 
painful. By now, the project is in its early stage, defining the API that we will implement in the near 
future.

Every help will be very useful :)

The library allows to test the following use cases:

## Use Case 1: The Application Produces Some Messages on a Topic

The first use case tests the messages produced by an application, reading them from the topic. The
code, producing the messages, is external to _Kafkaesque_. Through _Kafkaesque_, it is possible to assert
some properties on the messages generated by the application.

```
Kafkaesque
  .usingBroker(embeddedBroker)
  .<Key, Value>consume() // <-- create the builder KafkaesqueConsumerBuilder
  .fromTopic("topic-name")
  .withDeserializers(keyDeserializer, valueDeserializer)
  .waitingAtMost(10, SECONDS)
  .waitingEmptyPolls(2, 50L, MILLISECONDS)
  .expecting() // <-- build method that effectively consumes new KafkaesqueConsumer().poll()
  .havingRecordsSize(3) // <-- from here we use a ConsumedResult
  .havingHeaders(headers -> {
    // Assertions on headers
  })
  .havingKeys(keys -> {
    // Assertions on keys
  })
  .havingPayloads(payloads -> {
    // Asserions on payloads
  })
  .havingConsumerRecords(records -> {
    // Assertions on the full list of ConsumerRecord<Key, Value>
  })
  .assertingThatPayloads(contains("42")) // Uses Hamcrest.Matchers on collections :)
  .andCloseConsumer();
```

## Use Case 2: The Application Consumes Some Messages from a Topic

The second use case tests an application that reads messages from a topic. _Kafkaesque_ is 
responsible to produce such messages to trigger the execution of the application. It is also 
possible to assert conditions on the system state after the consumption of the messages.

```
Kafkaesque
  .usingBroker(embeddedBroker)
  .<Key, Value>produce() // <-- create the builder KafkaesqueProducerBuilder
  .toTopic("topic-name")
  .withDeserializers(keyDeserializer, valueDeserializer)
  .messages( /* Some list of messages */)
  .waitingAtMostForEachAck(100, MILLISECONDS) // Waiting time for each ack from the broker
  .waitingForTheConsumerAtMost(10, SECONDS) // Waiting time for the consumer to read one / all the messages
  .expecting() // build method that effectively create a producer
  .assertingAfterEach(message -> { // <- This method produce a message and asserts imme
    // Assertions on the consumer process after the sending of each message
  })
  .assertingAfterAll(messages -> {
    // Assertions on the consumer process after the sending of all the messages
  });
```

More to come!
